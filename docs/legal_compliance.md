# Legal Compliance Guidelines

This document outlines the key compliance considerations for content creators using the LoopForge platform. Following these guidelines helps ensure that your content adheres to platform policies and relevant regulations.

## Affiliate Disclosure Requirements

### FTC Requirements (United States)

1. **Clearly disclose** your relationship with the brands/products you're promoting
2. **Place the disclosure** where viewers will see it before engaging with affiliate links
3. **Use clear language** that the average viewer will understand

### Standard Affiliate Disclaimer Templates

Include one of these templates in all content with affiliate links:

#### Short-Form Video Caption (90 characters or less):
```
Some links may earn us a commission. See [yoursite.com/disclosure] for details.
```

#### Video Description:
```
DISCLOSURE: Some links in this description may be affiliate links. If you purchase a product through one of these links, I may earn a commission at no additional cost to you. I only recommend products I believe in.
```

#### Website/Landing Page:
```
This page contains affiliate links. When you purchase through these links, we may earn a commission which helps support our content at no additional cost to you. We only recommend products we believe will provide value to our audience. See our full disclosure policy at [yoursite.com/disclosure].
