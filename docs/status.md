## Current Testing Status
- **Total Coverage**: [Placeholder - Should be updated via coverage report]
- **Key Module Coverage**:
  - Notifications: [From report]
  - Pipeline Orchestrator (`run_pipeline.py`): [From report]
  - Prompt Generation: [From report]
  - Rendering (`local_renderer.py`, `comfyui.py`, `invokeai.py`): [From report]
  - Post-processing: [From report]
  - Upload: [From report]

## Phase 2: Enhancement (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Improve UI/UX for better usability (See GUI development)
- [x] Enhance error handling and resilience
  - [x] Implemented robust error handling in prompt_generation module
  - [x] Implemented robust error handling in rendering module
  - [x] Implemented robust error handling in post_processing module
  - [x] Added retry logic for API calls
  - [x] Added validation for generated content
  - [x] Implemented error handling and validation in upload module
- [x] Increase test coverage for remaining modules:
  - [x] `prompt_generation`
  - [x] `rendering` (Unit tests for BaseRenderers & E2E pipeline tests added)
  - [x] `post_processing`
  - [x] `upload`
- [ ] Implement performance optimizations
- [ ] Add batch processing capabilities

## Phase 3: GUI & User Experience (IN PROGRESS)
- [x] Develop Streamlit GUI (`gui.py`) for user-friendly pipeline execution
- [x] Add configuration checks and previews to GUI
- [x] Add batch topic input to GUI
- [x] Add progress indicators and live logging to GUI
- [x] Add asset pickers and notification toggles to GUI
- [x] Integrate modular renderer options into GUI
- [x] Add Demo Mode for easy onboarding
- [x] Refine GUI layout and styling

## Phase 4: Documentation & Onboarding (COMPLETED)
- [x] Rewrite `docs/setup.md` with Quick Start & Checklist
- [x] Add first-run welcome message
- [x] Create `check_setup.py` script
- [x] Update README with GUI section
- [x] Add example ComfyUI workflow
- [x] Add placeholder branding assets

## Latest Improvements ([Current Date])
- Added comprehensive unit tests for `ComfyUIRenderer` and `InvokeAIRenderer`.
- Implemented end-to-end integration tests for the main pipeline (`run_pipeline.py`), mocking external processes.
- Fixed path usage in `run_pipeline.py` stage validation to use configured paths.
- Resolved various test failures related to mocking and script execution flow.
- Updated status documentation.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Create `docs/technical.md` to document architecture and testing strategy.
- [ ] Create `tasks/tasks.md` for better task tracking.
- [ ] Run code coverage report and update status.
- [ ] Implement performance optimizations.
- [ ] Add batch processing capabilities.
- [ ] Continue UI/UX refinements.
