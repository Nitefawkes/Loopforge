# LoopForge Project Status

## Phase 1: Foundation and Testing (COMPLETED)

### Project Foundation
- [x] Set up basic project structure
- [x] Implement notification system with Email, Slack, and Discord support
- [x] Create GitHub repository
- [x] Set up basic GitHub Actions workflow

### Testing Framework
- [x] Implement unit tests for notifications module
- [x] Implement unit tests for pipeline orchestrator
- [x] Add tests for API prototype
- [x] Enable integration testing with mock components
- [x] Configure proper test directories and pytest settings
- [x] Set up code coverage reporting

### Documentation
- [x] Create comprehensive README
- [x] Document operational flow and dependencies
- [x] Maintain this status document to track progress

### CI/CD
- [x] Implement GitHub Actions workflow for linting and testing
- [x] Add code coverage reporting to CI process
- [x] Set up automatic test runs on push and pull requests

## Current Testing Status
- **Total Coverage**: 20%
- **Key Module Coverage**:
  - Notifications: 84%
  - Pipeline Orchestrator: 59%
  - Other modules: Need additional testing in Phase 2

## Phase 2: Enhancement (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Improve UI/UX for better usability
- [x] Enhance error handling and resilience
  - [x] Implemented robust error handling in prompt_generation module
  - [x] Implemented robust error handling in rendering module
  - [x] Added retry logic for API calls
  - [x] Added validation for generated content
  - [ ] Pending implementation in other modules
- [ ] Increase test coverage for remaining modules:
  - [x] `prompt_generation` (100% coverage achieved)
  - [x] `rendering` (comprehensive test suite implemented)
  - [ ] `post_processing`
  - [ ] `upload`
- [ ] Implement performance optimizations
- [ ] Add batch processing capabilities

## Latest Improvements (June 21, 2023)
- Enhanced the rendering module with:
  - Better exception handling with specific error types
  - Retry logic for API calls to rendering engines
  - Validation of prompt data before rendering
  - Integration with notification system
  - Improved logging and error reporting
  - Comprehensive unit test coverage
- Enhanced the prompt_generation module with:
  - Better exception handling with specific error types
  - Retry logic for API calls
  - Validation for generated content
  - Comprehensive unit tests
- Updated requirements.txt with new dependencies

## Next Steps
1. Continue implementation of Phase 2 tasks
2. Add error handling and test coverage for rendering module
3. Address bug fixes and improvements identified during testing
