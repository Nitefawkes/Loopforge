# Content Strategy Guidelines

This document outlines effective strategies for creating, publishing, and promoting content generated with LoopForge. Following these guidelines will help maximize engagement, conversion, and long-term growth.

## Content Planning

### 30-Day Content Buffer

Create a 45-60 day content buffer before going live:

1. **Batch Production**: Dedicate 1-2 full days to batch process your first set of content
2. **Uniform Quality**: Ensure consistent quality across all initial content
3. **Content Calendar**: Map out posting schedule with specific dates/times
4. **Safety Buffer**: This approach provides flexibility during unexpected events

### Content Mix Ratios

Balance your content with the following ratio:

- **70% Entertainment/Value**: Engaging, educational, or entertaining loops
- **20% Soft Promotion**: Gentle recommendations, use cases, or benefits
- **10% Direct Conversion**: Clear calls-to-action for affiliate links or products

## Content Performance Optimization

### Fail-Fast Testing

Test your content approach before investing heavy resources:

1. **Caption-Only Test**: Create 3-5 basic videos with captions only (no voice/bgm)
2. **48-Hour Analysis**: Check if they achieve >20% watch-through rate
3. **Iterate or Pivot**: If performance is poor, adjust approach rather than enhancing production value

### Performance Metrics to Track

Track these key metrics for each content piece:

- **Watch Time**: Complete views / Total views ratio
- **Engagement Rate**: (Likes + Comments + Shares) / Views
- **Click-Through Rate**: Link clicks / Views
- **Conversion Rate**: Purchases / Link clicks

### Analyzing Trends

1. Record data in a structured format (spreadsheet or dashboard)
2. Look for patterns in high-performing content:
   - Subject matter
   - Visual style
   - Caption length/style
   - Posting time/day
3. Double down on what works, eliminate what doesn't

## Platform-Specific Optimization

### YouTube Shorts

- **Duration**: 15-30 seconds is optimal
- **Hook**: First 3 seconds must grab attention
- **Captions**: Always include captions (40% watch with sound off)
- **End Screen**: Include clear next action
- **Posting Cadence**: 1-2 shorts daily, consistent timing

### TikTok

- **Trends**: Incorporate trending sounds/formats when relevant
- **Native Look**: Content should feel "homemade" even if professionally produced
- **Text**: Use bold, high-contrast text overlays
- **Hashtags**: 3-5 targeted hashtags (not generic)
- **Posting Cadence**: 2-3 videos daily, experiment with timing

### Instagram Reels

- **Polish**: Higher production value than TikTok
- **Aesthetic**: Maintain consistent visual style
- **Audio**: Original audio performs better for discovery
- **Hashtags**: 5-10 relevant, specific hashtags
- **Posting Cadence**: 1 Reel daily, consistent timing

## Monetization Strategy
