# Niche Selection Guide

Selecting the right niche is crucial for the success of your content strategy. This guide will help you identify, validate, and prepare for profitable niches.

## Selection Criteria

When evaluating potential niches, consider the following:

1. **Interest Alignment**: Choose topics that genuinely interest you to maintain long-term motivation
2. **Monetization Potential**: Assess affiliate program availability and commission structures
3. **Competition Level**: Look for the sweet spot with enough interest but not oversaturated
4. **Content Potential**: Ensure the niche has enough depth for ongoing content creation
5. **Visual Appeal**: Consider how well the niche translates to short-form video loops

## Validation Process

### 1. Trend Analysis

- **Google Trends (5-year view)**: Look for niches that show consistent interest or steady growth
  - Avoid short-term spikes without sustained interest
  - Compare multiple niches on the same graph to identify relative strength
  - URL: [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/)

- **Example Analysis**:
  - Strong: "Mechanical keyboards" (steady growth over 5 years)
  - Weak: "Fidget spinners" (huge spike followed by decline)

### 2. Monetization Research

- **Affiliate Program Analysis**:
  - Create a spreadsheet to track and compare affiliate programs
  - Include columns for:
    - Program name
    - Commission rate
    - Cookie duration
    - Payment threshold
    - Payment frequency
    - Recurring commission (yes/no)
  
- **High-Value Targets**:
  - **SaaS Products**: Look for recurring commission models (10-40%)
  - **High-Ticket Items**: Products with significant commissions ($50+)
  - **Program Tiers**: Note programs with performance bonuses or tier upgrades

### 3. Compliance Check

Identify any regulatory requirements for your niche:

- **Finance**: Requires specific disclaimers and often has strict promotional guidelines
- **Health/Fitness**: Claims must be carefully worded to avoid medical implications
- **Supplements**: Subject to specific advertising restrictions
- **Affiliate Disclosure**: Required for all niches (FTC rules)

Create standardized disclaimer templates for use across all content.
